    <h1>About Page</h1>
    
    <p>
      My name is Kyle Gruen and I am passionate about showing the world what it looks like through my eyes.<br>
      Originally from California, I moved to Virginia for new life opportunities, and to learn more about myself. <br>
      While everyday may bring new challenges, the opportunity to learn and grow keeps me pushing!<br>
      Someday I hope to travel the world alongside my puppy Ellie, doing photography. <br>
      Until that day comes, I will continue to cherish the moments I get to experience now. <br>
